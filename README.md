## Experience

### Senior Front-End Developer at DC Connected Car GmbH
*Germany* — *May 2023 - Present*

At DC Connected, I contribute to the development of a cutting-edge, AI-powered
platform that provides preventive and on-demand vehicle diagnostics. This
platform allows vehicle owners and fleet managers to resolve issues remotely,
reducing the need for on-site assistance and optimizing efficiency and costs
when supporting drivers. Through a chat with an AI that has context about
vehicles based on their make and model, users can obtain information and
personalized assistance.

**My specific responsibilities include:**

* Design and implementation of the UI architecture: From the beginning of the
project, I led the selection and implementation of SvelteKit as the main
framework, considering its alignment with web standards, its suitability for a
full-stack team, and its server-side rendering capabilities. This decision
facilitated a smooth learning curve for the team and optimized the platform's
performance.
* Mentoring and guidance for junior developers: I act as a mentor and reference
for junior developers on the team, providing them with technical support,
answering their questions, and guiding them in the use of SvelteKit, efficient
Git management, good development practices, and code documentation.
* Maintenance of UI repositories: I am responsible for reviewing the code
submitted by other developers, ensuring its quality, performing integrations
into the main branches, and executing deployments to development and testing
environments.
