## Experience

### Senior Front-End Developer and tech lead at [DC Connected Car GmbH](https://www.dc-connected.de/en)
*Germany* — *May 2023 - Present*

At DC Connected, I contribute to the development of a cutting-edge, AI-powered
platform that provides preventive and on-demand vehicle diagnostics. This
platform allows vehicle owners and fleet managers to resolve issues remotely,
reducing the need for on-site assistance and optimizing efficiency and costs
when supporting drivers. Through a chat with an AI that has context about
vehicles based on their make and model, users can obtain information and
personalized assistance.

**My specific responsibilities include:**

* **Design and implementation of the UI architecture:** From the beginning of the
  project, I led the selection and implementation of SvelteKit as the main
  framework, considering its alignment with web standards, its suitability for a
  full-stack team, and its server-side rendering capabilities. This decision
  facilitated a smooth learning curve for the team and optimized the platform's
  performance.
* **Mentoring and guidance for junior developers:** I act as a mentor and reference
  for junior developers on the team, providing them with technical support,
  answering their questions, and guiding them in the use of SvelteKit, efficient
  Git management, good development practices, and code documentation.

  submitted by other developers, ensuring its quality, performing integrations
  into the main branches, and executing deployments to development and testing
  environments.

*Los Altos, California, EE.UU.* - *November 2021 - January 2023*

At Wordly.ai, I contributed to the development and maintenance of the user
interface for a suite of AI-powered simultaneous interpretation solutions. These
solutions, designed to facilitate multilingual meetings, conferences, and
events, allowed me to gain valuable experience in creating intuitive and
user-friendly interfaces for cutting-edge AI technologies.

**My specific responsibilities included:**

* **Development of new features for two key products:** I worked on implementing
  new features for two main projects: a Zoom extension in Angular to add live
  translations to any conference, and a Chrome and Firefox extension in React to
  translate videos in real-time on web pages.
* **Efficient bug resolution:** I identified and solved bugs in existing
  applications, using my experience in Angular and React to address priority bugs
  in critical applications. I stood out for my ease in finding bugs and permanent
  solutions for them. In addition to writing unit-tests to help ensure that errors
  do not happen again and raising "post-mortem" documentation.
* **Effective collaboration in an agile environment:** I actively participated
  in the Kanban methodology, synchronizing daily with team leaders to organize
  priorities and ensure efficient delivery of tasks. Despite working remotely, I
  maintained fluid communication with the team and met deadlines.

developing new features, taking into account cross-browser compatibility, SEO,

experience in delivering high-quality e-commerce solutions.

  elements following MercadoLibre's accessibility guidelines, including color
  palettes and contrast requirements, to provide a user-friendly experience for
  individuals with color blindness or other visual impairments.
* **Working with a proprietary UI framework based on React:** I learned and
  effectively used MercadoLibre's proprietary UI framework, adapting to its
  specific conventions and functionalities while maintaining consistency with the
  overall platform design.
* **Performing on-call duties:** My responsibilities included incident
  resolution and bug fixing, monitoring application logs, recognizing alarms, and

### Globant - Frontend Developer & Technical Leader at [Globant](https://www.globant.com/)
